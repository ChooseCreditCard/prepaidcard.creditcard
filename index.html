          Prepaid cards use the same payment networks as credit cards, but they do not provide a line of credit. This page explains how loads, limits, fees and protections are documented — with a focus on first-time and student-style use-cases, not personal advice.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Prepaid Card?</h2>
      <p>A prepaid card is a payment card that is loaded with funds in advance. You can only spend the amount that has been loaded, minus any fees. There is no revolving credit line, no interest on carried balances and typically no traditional credit check for basic products.</p>
      <p>Even though the word “card” is shared with credit cards, prepaid cards behave more like a stored-value account. They still run on major payment networks, which is why they can be used at many of the same merchants as credit and debit cards.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Prepaid Cards Are Funded and Used</h2>
      <p>Documentation for prepaid cards usually describes the following elements:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Loading methods</strong> – bank transfers, cash loads at partner locations, wage deposits or transfers from other accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Spending limits</strong> – maximum balance, daily spend, ATM withdrawal limits and point-of-sale limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Card usage</strong> – where the card can be used (online, in-store, international), and any blocked merchant categories.</li>
        <li><strong>Expiration and dormancy</strong> – what happens when cards or balances are unused for extended periods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unlike credit cards, there is no borrowing: each transaction reduces the stored balance, and usage stops when the balance reaches zero or a configured threshold.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common Fees on Prepaid Cards</h2>
      <p>“Prepaid” does not automatically mean “no fees”. Fee schedules often include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Load fees</strong> – charges for adding funds via certain channels (for example cash loads).</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly or maintenance fees</strong> – recurring charges to keep the account active in some designs.</li>
        <li><strong>ATM withdrawal fees</strong> – charges for withdrawing cash, sometimes varying by ATM network or region.</li>
        <li><strong>FX fees</strong> – markups on foreign-currency transactions when used abroad or online.</li>
        <li><strong>Inactivity or dormancy fees</strong> – applied after long periods without usage, where allowed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The official fee schedule is the primary reference for understanding how much a prepaid product can cost to use over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Prepaid vs Credit vs Debit: Structural Differences</h2>
      <p>From a documentation perspective, the three common card types can be contrasted as follows:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Prepaid</strong> – spending is limited to loaded funds; no credit line; fees focus on loading, maintenance and usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit</strong> – provides a revolving line of credit with interest and fees; statements show balances owed.</li>
        <li><strong>Debit</strong> – draws directly from a bank account; fees and protections depend on account and region.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For students and first-time users, prepaid products are sometimes used as a way to learn card mechanics and budgeting without entering into a credit agreement.</p>

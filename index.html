  <section class="section">
    <h2>What is a prepaid card?</h2>
    <p class="small">
      A prepaid card is a payment card that you load with money before using it.
      You’re spending your own balance, not borrowing from a credit line.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• Load funds by bank transfer, cash, or another card</li>
      <li>• Spend online or in-store like a normal card</li>
      <li>• When the balance hits zero, transactions are declined</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Pros / cons -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Pros and cons vs. credit cards</h2>
    <p class="small">
      Prepaid cards behave differently from traditional credit cards:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• <strong>No credit line:</strong> you can’t go into card debt</li>
      <li>• <strong>No credit building:</strong> usage usually doesn’t build your credit score</li>
      <li>• <strong>Fewer perks:</strong> travel insurance and lounge access are rare</li>
      <li>• <strong>Often simpler KYC:</strong> but still regulated and verified</li>
    </ul>
